{"reminiscences-of-pioneer-days-in-st-paul": {"summaries_dict": {"0": ["In the mid-19th century, St. Paul was a rapidly growing city, and its newspaper industry was also experiencing significant changes. The story begins with a comparison between the old and new methods of producing newspapers. The author, Frank Moore, highlights the advancements made in the industry, including the introduction of the web-perfecting press, linotype machine, and mailing machine. These innovations enabled newspapers to produce more copies in less time, making them more accessible to the public.\n\nIn 1857, the election of delegates to the constitutional convention took place in Minnesota. The election was so close that the Republicans and Democrats held separate conventions. The Pioneer and the Minnesotian, two leading papers in the state, were awarded the contract to print the proceedings of the two conventions. The business manager of the Minnesotian, Mr. Moore, went to New York to purchase a Hoe press and a large quantity of type. However, an injunction was issued prohibiting him from drawing any money from the state until the question of the Minnesotian's right to do state printing was determined by the district court. The Minnesotian eventually won the case, and Mr. Moore divided a bag of gold, containing $4,000, among his employees.\n\nThe story also mentions the excitement surrounding the laying of the first Atlantic cable in 1858. The news was anxiously awaited, and the arrival of the Gray Eagle and Itasca, two fast boats on the river, was expected to bring the news. A passenger on the Gray Eagle had a copy of the Dubuque Herald containing the Queen's message, which was caught by a messenger from the Minnesotian, allowing them to publish an extra before their competitors.\n\nThe Minnesotian was the first daily paper in the West to illustrate a local feature, as seen in their coverage of the lynching of a man named Jackson in Wright county in 1859. The Pioneer Guards, a crack military company, was called out to arrest those involved in the tragedy, but they returned without firing a gun or seeing an enemy. The city editor of the Minnesotian, J. Fletcher Williams, wrote an extended account of the expedition, which was profusely illustrated with patent medicine cuts and inverted wood type.\n\nThe story also touches on the political history of Minnesota in 1859, where Alexander Ramsey and George L. Becker were rival candidates for governor. The Republicans made extraordinary efforts to elect their state and legislative tickets, and the story mentions the speakers imported by the Republicans, including the Hon. Galusha A. Grow and Hon. Schuyler Colfax. However, the evening speech by Mr. Colfax was interrupted by an alarm of fire, which destroyed the old People's theater.", "The story revolves around the author's experiences as a printer in St. Paul, Minnesota, during the mid-19th century. It begins with the author reminiscing about the 1850s, a time of great political upheaval in the United States. The Republicans had recently won an election, and the Minnesotian, a local newspaper, was celebrating with a bold headline. Dr. Foster, the editor of the Minnesotian, was a prominent figure in the Republican party, known for his fiery temper and sharp writing skills.\n\nAs the story progresses, the author describes the intense competition between the three daily papers in St. Paul: the Pioneer, the Minnesotian, and the Times. The newspapers would often engage in a \"typographical struggle\" to be the first to publish the president's message, with the winner receiving a grand oyster supper for their employees. The author also recalls a time when the proprietor of the Minnesotian attempted to intercept the mail coach to get a head start on the competition, but ended up receiving his own paper with the message instead.\n\nThe story also touches on the lack of enterprise among the daily papers at the time. Wages were low, and the authors were often paid in scrip that was not always worth its face value. The author notes that the situation improved with the arrival of the Press in 1861, which introduced the custom of paying employees every Saturday night. The author also describes a visit by a group of Republican statesmen to St. Paul in 1860, including Senator William H. Seward, who made a notable speech predicting that the capital of the United States would be located near the Falls of St. Anthony.\n\nThe story takes a humorous turn when the editor of the Pioneer, Earle S. Goodrich, plays a prank on the Minnesotian by creating bogus telegraph dispatches and passing them off as real news. The Minnesotian falls for the trick and publishes the fake news, which is later exposed by the Times. The story provides a glimpse into the cutthroat world of 19th-century journalism and the competitive spirit of the authors and editors who worked in the industry.", "The story revolves around the early days of newspapers in St. Paul, Minnesota, specifically the Pioneer and the Press. The narrative begins with the Pioneer retaining the monopoly of news until the Press was started on January 1, 1861. The Press secured telegraphic dispatches from Mr. Winslow, but faced difficulties in obtaining news, which led to a stormy interview between Gov. Marshall and Mr. Winslow. The Press eventually secured full telegraphic reports, and Gov. Marshall, a noble man, played a crucial role in obtaining accurate news.\n\nThe story highlights the patriotism of printers during the American Civil War. When President Lincoln called for \"three hundred thousand more\" in July 1862, many enlisted, and the Press struggled to present a respectable appearance. The narrative also features an elderly man, Metcalf, who, at 80 years old, helped set type for the Press. His son searched for him, but Metcalf insisted on staying until the paper was published.\n\nThe story touches on the draft during the Civil War, where Minnesota sent a significant number of men to fight. The draft was met with bitter opposition, and the Press, which advocated for the war, faced threats from anti-drafters. The office was barricaded, and a company was formed for self-defense, with Capt. E.R. Otis as the post commander. Although no riot occurred, the excitement eventually died down, and the draft took place without interruption.\n\nThe narrative also explores the history of newspapers in St. Paul, including the Daily Minnesotian, where the author worked. The author learned about scoops and the importance of obtaining news quickly. The story concludes with the expansion of daily newspapers during the latter part of the Civil War, which led to the introduction of new printing technologies, such as double-cylinder presses and linotype type-setting machines.\n\nThe story features key characters, including Gov. Marshall, Mr. Winslow, and Capt. E.R. Otis, as well as notable events, such as the draft and the expansion of newspapers. The narrative provides a glimpse into the early days of newspapers in St. Paul, Minnesota, and the crucial role they played during the American Civil War.", "The story takes place in the mid-19th century, specifically in the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, which was a major transportation hub due to the presence of the Mississippi River. Travelers arriving by steamboat would be greeted by various hotels, such as the Merchants hotel, the Western house, and the Hotel to the Wild Hunter, which was known for its peculiar sign. The city was bustling with activity, as merchants, residents, and dealers in town lots would gather at the levee to await the arrival of steamers.\n\nDuring this time, Minnesota was facing a significant economic downturn due to the great panic of 1857. However, the \"Five Million Loan Election\" aimed to alleviate this issue by donating funds to railroad companies to construct new roads. The amendment was overwhelmingly supported by the community, with the city of St. Paul giving a majority of over 4,000 in favor of the law. The amendment proposed to donate $10,000 per mile for every mile of road graded and ready to iron to four different railroad companies.\n\nThe passage of the law led to the commencement of work on the railroad construction, but it was soon met with controversy. Governor Sibley declined to issue the bonds as he felt that the state's rights were not being protected. However, the railroad companies obtained a writ from the supreme court, and Governor Sibley reluctantly signed the bonds. This decision would ultimately lead to the state's financial downfall, as the bonds could not be negotiated, and the credit of the state was compromised.\n\nThe story also touches on a battle fought between the Sioux and the Chippewas near Shakopee in May 1858. A party of Chippewa warriors, led by Chief Hole-in-the-day, surprised a group of Sioux, killing and wounding several. The event was reported by a young journalist named John W. Sickels, who was attached to the Times' editorial staff.\n\nOverall, the story provides a glimpse into the history of Minnesota during the mid-19th century, highlighting the state's economic struggles, the impact of the \"Five Million Loan Election,\" and the controversy surrounding the issuance of bonds.", "In the late 1850s, the city of St. Paul celebrated the successful laying of the Atlantic cable on September 1, 1858. The city council had been informed of the completion of the enterprise about two weeks prior, but the news had not reached St. Paul until then due to the lack of telegraphic communication. In preparation for the grand celebration, the city council allocated several hundred dollars to assist in the festivities. The city council prepared an elaborate program and procession that included various groups and floats, showcasing the city's military, fire department, and secret societies.\n\nOne of the unique features of the procession was the light brigade, consisting of school children mounted on horseback, acting as a guard of honor to the president and queen. The floats also represented the art of printing and bookbinding, with the Pioneer Printing company and book bindery showcasing their work. The procession was nearly two miles in length and took three and a half hours to complete. The celebration was led by Col. AC Jones, the marshal-in-chief, and was attended by various dignitaries, including Ex-Gov. W.A. Gorman and Ex-Gov. Alex. Ramsey, who delivered lengthy addresses.\n\nIn addition to the celebration, the story also touches on the history of the Atlantic cable. The cable had been in successful operation for about four weeks, with 129 messages received from England and 271 sent from America. The story also notes that a new company succeeded in laying the cable in 1866, which is still in operation today. The cable's history is marked by four failed attempts, including one in 1857, 1858, 1863, and 1865.\n\nThe story also introduces the secret order known as the Sons of Malta, which was organized in the Eastern states in the early 1850s. The order's membership grew rapidly, and a lodge was established in St. Paul in 1858. The order's initiation process was grand, gloomy, and peculiar, and its members would often confess to past transgressions during the initiation process. The order's scheme of bouncing candidates into the air from a rubber blanket was said to have been original with the Sons of Malta. The story also mentions a visit from a large excursion party of members from Cincinnati, Chicago, and Milwaukee, which included the celebrated elocutionist, Alf. Burnett.", "The story revolves around the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, during the mid-19th century. It begins with an account of a secret society, possibly a fraternal organization, that held a grand banquet at the hall of the order. The visitors, dressed in black robes, resembled prisoners from a play. The organization's popularity led to the Rev. John Penman becoming a member, but he later exposed the society's activities, causing a scandal that led to its decline.\n\nThe narrative shifts to the rivalry between two Republican papers, the Minnesotian and the Times. The two papers engaged in a war of words, with the Minnesotian referring to the Times' editor as \"Mr. Timothy Muggins Newson\" and the Times calling the Minnesotian's editor \"the red-nosed, goggle-eyed editor.\" The papers eventually consolidated, but the partnership was short-lived, and the offices separated. Dr. Foster took control of the Minnesotian, while Maj. Newson managed the Times.\n\nThe story also mentions several other newspapers in St. Paul, including the St. Paul Daily Press, which was established by W.R. Marshall and Thomas F. Slaughter after they leased the Times' office. The Press eventually became a competitor to the Minnesotian, and Dr. Foster was forced to surrender to its enterprising projectors.\n\nAdditionally, the narrative touches on the existence of the Daily North Star, a paper that was started during the presidential campaign of 1860 to support the Breckinridge or administration Democrats. The paper collapsed after the election due to a lack of support from officeholders. Another paper, the St. Paul Weekly Journal, was edited by Dr. Massey and opposed the prosecution of the war, but it only existed for about eight months.\n\nThe story also includes a humorous anecdote about the Minnesotian office receiving cases of bad whisky in payment of a debt. The whisky remained unmolested for over two years until it was finally consumed by the Little Giants, a uniformed political organization, during the 1860 campaign.", "The story is set during the American Civil War, specifically in 1862, when the United States government is struggling to cope with the rebellion in the South. The government's attention is diverted from the Native American tribes in Minnesota, particularly the Sioux, who are growing increasingly dissatisfied with the terms of the 1851 treaty. The Sioux had sold their lands in Minnesota, except for a narrow strip along the Minnesota River, but the sale of a portion of this strip in 1858, led by Little Crow, caused great dissatisfaction among the Indians.\n\nThe Sioux are facing hardship as the government paymasters have not arrived to distribute their annuities, which are payable in gold, and the Indians are told that the government does not have the funds to pay them due to the war. This leads to a growing sense of resentment and a desire for war among the Sioux, who believe that now is the time to reclaim their land. The Confederate government is suspected of having emissaries among the Sioux, but this is denied by the Indians.\n\nAs the situation escalates, the people of Minnesota are called upon to furnish five regiments for the war effort, but before the men can be mustered in, open hostilities break out at the upper agency, and an indiscriminate massacre of the whites begins. The farmer Indians, who have been trying to adopt a more civilized way of life, are among those responsible for the atrocities.\n\nThe outbreak spreads rapidly, and within a week, 1,000 people have been killed, millions of dollars' worth of property destroyed, and 30,000 people rendered homeless. The state and national authorities are faced with the problem of how to repel the invaders and drive them back to their reservations. The Chippewas are also assuming a warlike attitude, and it is feared that they may join forces with the Sioux to commit further atrocities.", "The story revolves around the Indian war in Minnesota, which broke out unexpectedly and rapidly spread, forcing settlers to flee their homes and causing widespread destruction. The governor, Ramsey, called an emergency session of the legislature to devise means to arm volunteers and assist homeless refugees in finding safe shelters. Ex-Gov. Sibley was placed in command of the troops ordered to assemble at St. Peter, and he led detachments of regiments in offensive operations against the Sioux.\n\nOther Day, an educated Dakota Indian, piloted sixty-two men, women, and children across the country from below Yellow Medicine to Kandiyohi, and from there to Hutchinson, Glencoe, and Carver. He had experienced a change of heart and adopted the habits of civilization. Other Day arrived in St. Paul a few days after piloting his party in safety to Carver and attributed his success to the mercy of the Great Spirit.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indian war was in earnest, and the newspapers and people were crying \"On to Ridgely!\" which was then beleaguered. Fort Ridgely, a fort in name, was under the command of Lieut. T.J. Sheehan, who bravely defended the fort with a garrison of 150 men, 50 men of the Renville Rangers, and a number of civilians against 700-800 Sioux. The siege was kept up for several days, and after a week, the little garrison was relieved by the arrival of 200 mounted volunteers under Col. McPhail.\n\nAlmost simultaneously with the attack on Fort Ridgely, the Indians appeared in the vicinity of New Ulm, with the intention of burning and pillaging the village. Judge Charles E. Flandrau organized a company of volunteers and marched across the country to the relief of New Ulm. They arrived just in time to assist the inhabitants in driving the Indians from the upper part of the village. However, the Indians later appeared in large force, surrounded the town, and commenced burning the buildings on its outskirts. After a desperate encounter, the Indians retired, but not before burning nearly two hundred houses.\n\nAs the situation worsened, Gen. Sibley arrived at Fort Ridgely, and a detail of troops was sent out to bury the dead and rescue the wounded from their perilous surroundings. However, the troops were surrounded by 400-500 hostile warriors and were eventually forced to defend themselves.", "The story takes place in Minnesota, specifically in St. Paul, during the Dakota War of 1862. The conflict began when a group of Dakota warriors, led by Little Crow, attacked a settlement, killing and wounding many citizens. This event sparked a wave of panic and outrage among the residents of St. Paul, who felt threatened by the approaching Dakota forces.\n\nGovernor Ramsey attempted to reassure the public that the city was safe, but the frontiersmen were unconvinced. The situation became more dire as settlers fled their homes, leaving their crops to perish in the field. The home guards were organized, but they were poorly armed and equipped to face the well-armed Dakota warriors.\n\nGeneral Sibley eventually led a force of about 2,000 men, including the Third regiment, to confront the Dakota. On September 23, 1862, they encountered a group of Dakota warriors near Wood Lake, and after a spirited engagement, the Dakota were routed. The battle resulted in four white soldiers killed and 40-50 wounded.\n\nThe conflict eventually came to an end when General Sibley's command reached a large camp of Indians, where they found about 250 mixed-bloods and white women and children. The soldiers were anxious to rescue the captives, but General Sibley proceeded with caution, fearing that any hostile demonstration would result in the annihilation of the prisoners. After a few days, the entire camp surrendered, and the captives were released.\n\nA military tribunal was formed to try the Dakota warriors who had participated in the massacres. After a series of sittings, 321 Dakota warriors were found guilty of various crimes, and 303 were sentenced to death. However, the president intervened, and only 38 of the most flagrant cases were executed on December 26, 1862. The rest were spared, and the condemned prisoners were interviewed by Rev. S.R. Riggs, who recorded their dying confessions.\n\nThe story also provides background information on key characters, such as Little Crow, the chief instigator of the insurrection, and Wabasha, a Sioux chief who was not found guilty of participating in the massacres. The story highlights the complexities of the conflict and the motivations of the characters involved.", "In the Minnesota valley, a war party led by a leader greatly disliked by the Indians was engaged in a struggle against the whites. The leader was the acknowledged head of the war party, and his actions led to the execution of thirty-eight Indians, sparking widespread excitement and calls for summary justice. Petitions were circulated in St. Paul in favor of removing the condemned Indians to Massachusetts, but the government ultimately decided to execute only thirty-eight. The remaining condemned Indians were kept in close confinement until spring, when they were transported to Davenport and eventually to a point on the Missouri river.\n\nThis event was part of a larger conflict between the government and the Sioux, who had forfeited their land and annuity due to their actions. The Sioux had held about 750,000 acres of land in Minnesota, worth approximately $15,000,000 at the time, and had an annual annuity of $68,000 for fifty years. The conflict had a significant impact on the local population, with many farmers leaving their harvesters to join the army and their wives finishing the harvest. The Ladies' Aid Society was formed in response to the appeal of Gov. Sibley and other officers, with the goal of furnishing sick and wounded soldiers with supplies.\n\nIn St. Paul, the military authorities were struggling to transport supplies to the troops on the frontier. The owners of draft horses did not respond quickly enough, leading the authorities to issue an order to forcibly impress teams into service. A detachment of Company K of the Eighth regiment was sent to the city to enforce this order, and they took possession of several teams, including one belonging to a disloyal farmer who had boasted that the government could not locate his team. The government also took possession of Gov. Ramsey's carriage team, despite the driver's protests that the governor was the owner.\n\nThe story also highlights the bravery and foolishness of a young man named Hines, who claimed to be as brave as Julius Caesar and was heavily loaded with various weapons. His companions tested his bravery by pretending to be Indians and attacking the train, causing Hines to flee in panic.", "In the early 19th century, firefighting in Europe and the United States was a primitive and labor-intensive process, relying on bucket brigades and manual pumps. The introduction of steam-powered fire engines marked a significant improvement, with the first recorded use of a fire engine in Paris in 1684. As the technology evolved, so did the organization of firefighting services, with the establishment of paid steam fire departments in cities like Cincinnati.\n\nIn St. Paul, Minnesota, the need for a firefighting service became apparent, and in 1850, the town fathers passed an ordinance requiring building owners to provide buckets marked with the word \"Fire.\" The first attempt at organizing a fire brigade was made by R.C. Knox in 1851, who raised funds and purchased ladders, which were frequently used by the small band of volunteers.\n\nTwo public-spirited citizens, John McCloud and Thompson Ritchie, brought the first fire engine to St. Paul, a miniature affair that provided valuable assistance in protecting the property of pioneer merchants. The Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 was organized in 1854, with a constitution and by-laws that included a membership roll of prominent citizens, including John McCloud, who is credited as the \"Father of the Volunteer Fire Department of St. Paul.\" The company was initially self-funded but eventually became financially embarrassed, leading to the city taking control of the organization in 1856.\n\nThe city purchased two new fire engines in 1858, which were tested and deemed satisfactory, leading citizens to congratulate themselves on having a first-class fire department. The introduction of these new engines marked a significant improvement in firefighting capabilities, and the city's residents predicted that great fires would become a thing of the past. The story also highlights the character of A.D. Martin, a little red-headed Irishman who was a foreman of the Daily Minnesotian office and a member of the Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company, known for his enthusiasm and occasional antics.", "The story revolves around the early history of the St. Paul fire department. In the fall of 1858, a large number of prominent businessmen in the vicinity of Seven Corners joined the organization, which was later named Minnehaha Engine Company No. 2. The first officers of this company were H.P. Grant, M.J. O'Connor, and H.B. Terwilliger, and they were assisted by members such as Harry M. Shaw, Nicholas Hendy, and John B. Oliver. This organization was a prosperous one, and its engine house served as a general lounging and reading-room for its members.\n\nThe story also mentions the Rotary Independent Company No. 1, a private institution that was only used on general alarms and during the annual parade of the department. This engine was purchased from the government and was used for the protection of the property of a mill located on lower Third street. The annual parade of the St. Paul fire department became an event of the year, and it was participated in by the Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1, Hope Engine Company No. 1, Minnehaha Engine Company No. 2, and Rotary Independent Company No. 1.\n\nThe city fathers thought they had a respectable fire department after the formation of Minnehaha Engine Company. However, the arrival of the first steamer in 1866 brought significant changes to the department. The new steamer was lodged with Hope Engine Company, and an engineer and fireman were appointed at a salary of $1,600 per year for the two. The boys of Hope Engine Company did not like the selection of the engineer of the new steamer and took the matter so seriously that their organization was disbanded, and St. Paul Hose Company No. 1 was organized.\n\nThe story also highlights the contributions of Mrs. Bartlett Presley, who was a guardian angel of the fire department. She provided coffee and sandwiches for the tired and hungry firemen who had been heroically battling with the flames. The story also mentions the Hon. Michael E. Ames, a lawyer who was known for his punctiliousness and sublime imperturbability. His apartment was discovered to be on fire one winter night, and he asked the firemen to desist from operations until he arranged his toilet.", "The story revolves around the numerous fires that ravaged St. Paul, destroying several hotels, buildings, and landmarks. The narrative begins with the Sintominie hotel, constructed by C.W. Borup, which was the pride of lower town but was destroyed due to the lack of fire protection. The Rice house, a three-story high brick building constructed by Henry M. Rice, was considered the first brick building in St. Paul but was also burned to the ground.\n\nThe Canada house and the Galena house, two small frame structures, were next to be visited by the fiery element. However, the most destructive fire occurred on March 16, 1860, when nearly all the buildings on Third street from Robert to Jackson were destroyed. The fire department, consisting of three engines and one truck, manned by one hundred men, managed to cut off the leap across Robert street and brought the flames under control. Thirty-four buildings were destroyed, leaving only three stone structures and a four-story brick building standing.\n\nThe New England, a two-story log house and one of the first hotels built in St. Paul, was among the ruins. The Empire saloon, which housed the first printing office of the territory, was also destroyed. The Hotel to the Wild Hunter was another casualty of the fire. In 1862, the Winslow house, a four-story brick building constructed by J.M. Winslow, was destroyed by a defective stovepipe in the cupola.\n\nThe American house, a landmark of the city, was built in 1849 and was a popular hotel among territorial politicians. However, it was destroyed by a fire on a stormy night in December 1863. The firemen managed to save the guests, but thieves made off with a large amount of jewelry and apparel. The Cosmopolitan hotel, a three-story brick building, was remodeled into a hotel on the European plan but was destroyed by a fire. A doctor, Dr. Schell, was trapped under the rubble of the hotel's walls, which had collapsed due to a windstorm.\n\nIn 1868, the Emmert house, a boarding house, was destroyed by fire, and two people with smallpox were rescued by courageous firemen. The story also mentions the Mansion house, a three-story frame building, which was a popular resort for weary travelers.", "The summer of 1866 witnessed a tragic event at a house in St. Paul, where a guest named Hawkes accidentally shot and killed his young wife, leading to his acquittal after a sensational trial. In contrast, the city experienced a major catastrophe on February 3, 1869, when the International hotel, a five-story brick building, caught fire in the basement, believed to be caused by a lamp in the laundry. The hotel, which had been the headquarters for notable figures such as William H. Seward and General Pope, was home to over 200 guests, including several politicians and dignitaries, when the fire broke out.\n\nDespite the intense cold and strong gale, the fire department managed to rescue everyone without any loss of life or injury. The night watchman, Pete O'Brien, played a crucial role in ensuring the guests' safety by calmly informing them of the danger and guiding them to safety. The fire department worked diligently, relying on cisterns and steamers to pump water through over two thousand feet of hose to combat the blaze.\n\nOther notable hotel fires in St. Paul include the Park Place hotel, which burned down in 1878, and the Carpenter house, which was destroyed in 1879. The Central house on Bench street, one of the first hotels in the city, was eventually converted into a boarding house and was later destroyed by fire in 1873. The Greenman house, a three-story frame structure, was also destroyed by fire, although the exact date is not specified.\n\nThe story also mentions the Concert Hall building on Third street, which was destroyed by fire in May 1870. The building, which had been constructed in 1857, was a significant cultural hub in the city, featuring a large hall in the basement. The story provides a glimpse into the history of St. Paul, highlighting the city's growth and development, as well as the challenges and calamities it faced during the late 19th century.", "In a tragic incident, a fire broke out in a building in St. Paul, and two brothers, Charles and August Mueller, found themselves trapped in their tailor shop on the top floor. The fire spread rapidly, engulfing the building in flames, and the brothers were left with no possible way to escape. However, they bravely made a leap for life, and despite the odds, they were lifted into beds and recovered after months of suffering. Unfortunately, a lady named McClellan, who had a dressmaking establishment in the building, was burned to death.\n\nThe story then shifts to the early amusement halls in St. Paul, where it is revealed that the three-story, three-cornered building on Third street at Seven Corners once contained a popular amusement hall called Irvine hall. Dan Emmet had a minstrel company at this hall during the years 1857 and 1858, featuring talented performers such as Frank Lombard, Max Irwin, and Johnny Ritter. One of the notable incidents that took place at Irvine hall was when the Hutchinson family performed, and one of the brothers got stuck on Pig's Eye bar, leading to a dramatic reunion on stage.\n\nDan Emmet, the leader of the minstrel company, was a superior man who was his own worst enemy. He was a brother of Lafayette S. Emmett, the chief justice of the supreme court of the State of Minnesota. Dan Emmet left a lasting legacy in the world of melody, writing several popular airs, including \"Dixie,\" which became the national air of the Confederate States. The song was first performed in St. Paul and gained popularity after being sung in the music store of Munger Bros. The story also mentions the Hutchinson family, who were a very patriotic family and often sang their own music in St. Paul. They were even ordered out of the Army of the Potomac by Gen. McClellan due to their abolition sentiments expressed in their songs.", "The story revolves around the history of St. Paul, Minnesota, and its cultural and social landscape during the mid-to-late 19th century. The narrative begins by mentioning the Henry M. Rice homestead, where a member of the regular army lived. It then shifts to the life of John W. Hutchinson, a renowned singer and musician who was celebrating his 81st birthday in 1902. Hutchinson was a prominent figure in the anti-bellum era and had written many songs, including \"The Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man\" and \"The Blue and the Gray.\" He was also an advocate for woman's suffrage and had written a song about it, titled \"Good Times for Women.\"\n\nThe story takes a turn to the past, describing the Concert Hall built in 1857 by J.W. McClung. The hall was a popular venue for musical performances and speeches, including a notable address by Tom Marshall, a famous Kentucky orator who was visiting Minnesota to recover from his excessive drinking habit. Marshall's speech was met with laughter and ridicule from a group of Little Giants, who had mistakenly thought he would praise their leader, Stephen Douglas. The hall also hosted a Democratic meeting, where De Witt C. Cooley, a witty speaker, was the main attraction, but his speech was interrupted by an Irishman who had been called upon to \"holler for Cooley.\"\n\nThe narrative then shifts to the Athenaeum, a German Reading society-built hall that served as the only amusement hall in St. Paul with a stage and drop curtain. The hall hosted various performances, including a cantata for the benefit of the sanitary commission during the war. The story also mentions the construction of Market hall in 1853, which became a principal place of amusement, and the Ingersoll block on Bridge Square, which hosted many distinguished speakers.\n\nOverall, the story provides a glimpse into the cultural and social life of St. Paul during the mid-to-late 19th century, highlighting the city's rich history, its notable figures, and the various events that took place in its halls and venues.", "In St. Paul, various entertainment venues and events took place in the mid to late 19th century. The city's first public library was established in 1861, with the aid of the Young Men's Christian association, in a hall on the second story of a building. The ladies of the Protestant churches raised funds for the library through a social and supper event, which was attended by large delegations from the different churches. A room was fitted up on the second story, and the beginning of the St. Paul library was opened to the public with around 350 books, with patrons required to pay one dollar per year for permission to read them.\n\nThe People's theater, an old frame building on the corner of Fourth and St. Peter streets, was the only real theatrical building in the city. H. Van Liew was the lessee and manager of this place of entertainment, with a very good stock company. Emily Dow and her brother, Harry Gossan, and Azelene Allen were among the members. Notable actors, Mr. and Mrs. J.W.

This innovation significantly impacted the competitive world of 19th-century journalism, with newspapers such as The Pioneer and Minnesotian vying for the attention of the local population.\n\nA significant event that drew the attention of St. Paul residents in 1858 was the completion of the Atlantic cable, marking the first time a transatlantic communication had occurred. The news of this achievement sparked a grand celebration in the city, featuring a colorful parade with various groups and floats showcasing the city's military, fire department, and secret societies. This event, known as the \"Laying of the Atlantic Cable Celebration,\" helped solidify St. Paul's reputation as a beacon of innovation and progress.\n\nIn the following years, St. Paul continued to experience transformative events, particularly during the early 1860s. In 1860, a large excursion party of members of the Sons of Malta visited the city, which included notable figures such as the celebrated elocutionist, Alf. Burnett. This secret order, organized in the Eastern states in the early 1850s, had made a significant impact in the region's social scene. However, some stories surrounding the Sons of Malta suggested that their initiation process was quite peculiar and often bordering on the sinister.\n\nAs the decade progressed, the United States nation found itself embroiled in the American Civil War. In 1861, Minnesota was required to furnish five regiments for the war effort, sparking a chain of events that would lead to the Dakota War of 1862. President Jefferson informed General Gold, the U.S. commander at Sioux Falls, that several hundred volunteers were needed to be sent to northeastern Nebraska to defuse the war crisis between Native Americans. The situation escalated rapidly, leading to the outbreak of violence in Minnesota, resulting in the deaths of over 1,000 people and millions of dollars in property damage.\n\nGeneral Sibley ultimately led a force of approximately 2,000 men to confront the Sioux and her forces in the growing escalating conflict. On September 23, 1862, they encountered a group of Sioux warriors near Wood Lake, leading to a spirited engagement, with the Sioux being ultimately routed. However, the aftermath of the war brought numerous controversies, particularly surrounding the deaths of thirty-eight Indians, with many Native Americans viewing the event as an execution.\n\nThe union rose victorious in the end. Captain Shelly mustered out of the service in the spring of 1865 and went back to being a printer after having a considerable presence in battles and victories throughout the American Civil War period. His first military role started at the early stages of the war in 1861; he obtained honors after fighting eruptively at the pivotal point in the Mill Springs campaign where they directly fought Confederate forces and captured a significant amount of their firearms."}}
