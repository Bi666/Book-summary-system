{"reminiscences-of-pioneer-days-in-st-paul": {"summaries_dict": {"0": ["In the mid-19th century, St. Paul, Minnesota, was a rapidly growing city, with its newspaper industry evolving significantly over the years. The city's early newspapers, such as the Pioneer and the Minnesotian, were small operations with limited resources, employing one pressman, a few compositors, two editors, and a business manager. The industry's growth was hindered by the lack of modern technology, with a single hand press capable of producing only 240 impressions per hour.\n\nIn 1857, a constitutional convention was held in Minnesota, and the Minnesotian was awarded the contract to print the proceedings of the Democratic convention. However, the Pioneer, led by state printer Mr. Goodrich, claimed the right to print the proceedings of both conventions, leading to a court case that ultimately favored the Minnesotian. The Minnesotian's business manager, Mr. Moore, was able to distribute $4,000 to his employees after the court's decision.\n\nThe city's residents eagerly awaited news of the successful laying of the Atlantic cable in 1858, with two steamboats, the Gray Eagle and the Itasca, racing to bring the news to St. Paul. The Minnesotian's messenger was able to obtain a copy of the Dubuque Herald containing the Queen's message, allowing the newspaper to publish an extra edition before its competitors.\n\nThe Minnesotian was also a pioneer in local feature illustration, with a notable example being the lynching of a man in Wright county in 1859. The Pioneer Guards, a crack military company, was called out to arrest those involved, but they were ultimately unsuccessful in their mission. The incident was covered extensively by the Minnesotian, with city editor J. Fletcher Williams writing a detailed account of the expedition.\n\nThe same year saw a heated gubernatorial election between Alexander Ramsey and George L. Becker, with the Republicans making significant efforts to elect their state and legislative tickets. The election was marked by the presence of prominent speakers, including the Hon. Galusha A. Grow and the Hon. Schuyler Colfax, whose speeches were interrupted by a fire that destroyed the old People's theater where they were scheduled to speak. Despite the chaos, the Minnesotian was able to publish an account of the event, highlighting the newspaper's dedication to providing timely and accurate information to its readers.", "The story is set in the mid-19th century in St. Paul, Minnesota, and revolves around the author's experiences as a printer and employee of the Minnesotian, a local newspaper. The narrative begins with the author reminiscing about the Republican party's victory in an election, which was celebrated by the Minnesotian's editor, Dr. Foster, who was a prominent figure in the Republican party. Dr. Foster was known for his irascible temper and his ability to write scathing editorials, as evident from his reaction to the execution of John Brown and President Buchanan's veto of the Homestead Law.\n\nThe story then shifts to the early days of the St. Paul daily papers, specifically the Pioneer, Minnesotian, and Times, which engaged in a fierce competition to be the first to print the president's message. The proprietor of the Minnesotian attempted to gain an advantage by intercepting the mail coach, but the effort ultimately failed. The newspapers also struggled with the high cost of telegraph news, which made it difficult for them to keep up with the latest news. The Minnesotian and Times eventually formed an agreement to boycott the telegraph company's extortionate rates, but the Pioneer secretly made a deal with the company, leaving the other two papers at a disadvantage.\n\nThe narrative also touches on the economic struggles of the time, with wages being low and money scarce. Married men were considered fortunate to receive an order for $4 or $5 on Saturday night, while single men received even less. The introduction of the Press in 1861 brought about a change in the custom of paying employees every Saturday night.\n\nThe story also mentions a notable visit by Republican statesmen, including William Seward, who predicted that the capitol of the United States would be located near the Falls of St. Anthony. However, the news of his speech was only available to those who could access the New York Herald. The completion of the telegraph line in 1860 brought about a new era of news dissemination, but the high costs made it difficult for the papers to afford the \"latest news by Associated Press.\" The Pioneer's editor, Earle S. Goodrich, played a prank on the Minnesotian by creating bogus telegraph dispatches, which the Minnesotian fell for, only to be later exposed by the Times.", "The story revolves around the early days of the newspaper industry in St. Paul, Minnesota, specifically focusing on the Pioneer and the Press. The narrative begins with the Pioneer retaining a monopoly on news until the Press started operations in 1861. Initially, the Press struggled to obtain telegraphic dispatches, but after a stormy meeting with Mr. Winslow, the governor, they secured the necessary access.\n\nGovernor Marshall, a noble man, was deeply affected by the Union's defeat at the first battle of Bull Run, but he later became one of the bravest in battling for his country's honor. The Press and its employees were very patriotic, and when President Lincoln called for 300,000 more soldiers in 1862, many enlisted, making it challenging for the paper to maintain a respectable appearance.\n\nThe narrator, who started working at the Daily Minnesotian in 1858, learned about the concept of a \"scoop\" when the Pioneer published news of Minnesota's admission to the Union before the other papers. However, with the establishment of the telegraph line in 1860, the era of scoops came to an end. The narrator's experience at the Daily Minnesotian was short-lived, and he later joined the Press.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the Press and its employees, including Captain E.R. Otis, took a strong stance in advocating for the war effort. When the draft was introduced, the Press faced threats from anti-drafters, but the employees were prepared to defend themselves. The narrator, who slept in the office, was tasked with giving the alarm in case of an attack. Although the draft took place without incident, the city's residents celebrated the Union victories on the Fourth of July in 1863, with the Press issuing an extra edition that was in high demand.\n\nThe narrative also touches on the expansion of the newspaper industry in St. Paul, with the introduction of new printing technologies, including double-cylinder presses, turtle-back presses, stereotyping, and linotype type-setting machines. The story concludes with a glimpse into the future, speculating about the potential replacement of printers and proofreaders with photography-based systems.", "The narrative is set in the mid-19th century, specifically in the state of Minnesota, where traveling by steamboat was a common mode of transportation. The story begins by describing the bustling atmosphere at the levee, where various steamboats, such as the Galena, Dunleith, Dubuque and Minnesota Packet company, would arrive, carrying travelers and goods. The steamboats were a significant part of the community, with their distinctive whistles and announcements, and the officers were considered important figures.\n\nIn the midst of this scene, the narrative shifts to discuss a significant event in Minnesota's history - the \"Five Million Loan Election.\" This election was a pivotal moment in the state's development, as it aimed to donate $10,000 per mile to railroad companies for every mile of road graded and ready to be ironed. The measure was overwhelmingly supported by the community, with even the leading men of both parties favoring it. However, the Minnesotian, a prominent newspaper edited by Dr. Thomas Foster, opposed the passage of the law, leading to a heated campaign.\n\nThe amendment was eventually passed, and work on the railroads began. However, the state's financial reputation was compromised when the railroad companies obtained a writ from the supreme court, forcing Governor Sibley to issue the bonds. Dr. Foster continued to denounce the governor's actions, claiming that the issuance of the bonds was fraudulent and illegal. The state's credit was eventually compromised, and the railroad companies defaulted, leaving the state with a significant financial burden.\n\nThe narrative then shifts to a violent conflict between the Sioux and Chippewa tribes near Shakopee in May 1858. A party of Chippewa warriors, led by Chief Hole-in-the-day, attacked a group of Sioux, killing and wounding several people. The incident was widely reported in the newspapers, and a young reporter, John W. Sickels, provided a graphic description of the events. The conflict highlighted the long-standing enmity between the two tribes.\n\nOverall, the narrative provides a glimpse into the history of Minnesota, highlighting the state's development, the role of steamboats, and the conflicts between the Native American tribes. The story also introduces key figures, such as Governor Sibley and Dr. Thomas Foster, and sets the stage for the state's financial struggles and the consequences of its actions.", "In the late 1850s, St. Paul, a city in the United States, celebrated the successful laying of the Atlantic cable on September 1, 1858. The city council allocated funds to organize a grand celebration, which was one of the most elaborate events in the city's history. Thousands of spectators from the city and surrounding areas gathered to watch the procession, which featured various floats, bands, and military units. The celebration included a light brigade consisting of school children, a floral procession, and a unique representation of Queen Victoria and President Buchanan.\n\nThe city's military units, including the Pioneer Guards and the City Guards, participated in the procession, showcasing their Minie rifles and bayonets. The fire department, under Charles H. Williams, also participated, and the Pioneer Printing company created elaborate floats representing printers and printing in the days of Benjamin Franklin. The floats were designed by George H. Colgrave, a prominent figure in the Pioneer Press company. The event also featured a barouche with juvenile representatives of Queen Victoria and President Buchanan, as well as other notable figures such as Col. R.E.J. Miles and Miss Emily Dow, who represented George and Martha Washington.\n\nThe Sons of Malta, a secret order founded in the Eastern states, had a significant presence in St. Paul. In 1858, two or three members of the Pioneer editorial staff procured a charter from Pittsburgh and established a lodge in St. Paul. The lodge quickly gained popularity, attracting merchants, lawyers, doctors, and printers. However, the initiation process was notorious for its grand, gloomy, and peculiar nature, which often led to the confession of past transgressions by candidates. The order's scheme of bouncing candidates into the air from a rubber blanket was also a notable feature.\n\nAs the story progresses, a group of members from Cincinnati, Chicago, and Milwaukee, including the elocutionist Alf. Burnett and Gov. Alexander Randall, visit St. Paul. This event sets the stage for further interactions between the characters and the Sons of Malta, hinting at potential conflicts and relationships that will unfold in the narrative. The story provides a glimpse into the social and cultural landscape of the late 19th century, highlighting the city's celebrations, secret societies, and the complexities of human nature.", "In the mid-19th century, the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, was a hub of newspaper activity, with several publications vying for readers' attention. The Minnesotian and Times, two Republican papers, were bitter rivals, often engaging in a war of words, with the Minnesotian's editor, Dr. Foster, referring to the Times' editor, Thomas M. Newson, as \"Mr. Timothy Muggins Newson.\" Despite their animosity, the two papers eventually consolidated, but the partnership was short-lived, and they eventually went their separate ways.\n\nDuring this time, other newspapers emerged in St. Paul, including the Daily North Star, which supported the Breckinridge Democrats, and the St. Paul Weekly Journal, edited by Dr. Massey, which opposed the prosecution of the Civil War. However, the Daily North Star was short-lived, and the St. Paul Weekly Journal folded after eight months due to its unpopular stance.\n\nIn the Minnesotian office, a peculiar situation arose when a shipment of bad whisky arrived in payment of a debt. The office staff was hesitant to consume the liquor, and it remained untouched for over two years. However, during the 1860 presidential campaign, the Minnesotian staff invited the Little Giants to the office, and in a gesture of goodwill, they shared the whisky with the Democratic group, adhering to one of the Democratic party's principles: \"love rum and hate <DW65>s.\"\n\nThe story then shifts to the backdrop of the Civil War, with President Lincoln issuing proclamations calling for 600,000 volunteers to reinforce the army. In Minnesota, the Great Sioux Outbreak of 1862 was underway, with violent events unfolding at Fort Ridgely, New Ulm, Birch Coulee, and other locations. The situation in St. Paul was also tense, with great excitement and uncertainty gripping the city.\n\nKey figures in this narrative include Dr. Foster, the editor of the Minnesotian, Thomas M. Newson, the editor of the Times, and George W. Moore, a journalist who was associated with the Minnesotian before the consolidation. Other notable individuals include H.H. Young, the editor of the Henderson Independent, and Dr. Massey, the editor of the St. Paul Weekly Journal. The story provides a glimpse into the lives of these individuals and the newspapers they worked for, as well as the tumultuous events that shaped the city of St. Paul during the mid-19th century.", "The story begins in the midst of the American Civil War, where the government is facing numerous challenges, including a disastrous retreat by McClellan and severe reverses by the army under Pope. The Union army in the West, led by Grant, Buell, and Curtis, has been unable to make significant progress against the Confederacy. Meanwhile, Confederate privateers are evading the Union navy and selling cotton in Europe to fund their cause. The situation is further complicated by rumors of foreign intervention and conspiracies to burn Northern cities.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, a critical event unfolds in the western boundaries of Minnesota, where one of the most heinous atrocities in Indian warfare history takes place. The Sioux, who had sold their lands to the government in the 1851 Treaty of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota, are dissatisfied with their treatment and the scarcity of game and trapping opportunities on the south side of the Minnesota River. Many Indians, led by Little Crow, are reluctant to adopt the habits of civilization and work like white men, instead wanting to live as they did before the war. The government has built houses and provided tools for those willing to farm, but the disinclination to work among the Indians has created tension and led to the formation of two groups: the \"white man's party\" and the \"Indian party.\"\n\nAs the government struggles to provide funds for the war, the Indians are told that their annuities will not be paid due to the war, leading to widespread discontent. The situation is further complicated by the enlistment of men in the Union army, which leaves the state vulnerable to attack. The outbreak begins when a portion of Little Six's band murders several people in Action, Meeker county, and then flees to Redwood. On August 18th, an indiscriminate massacre is launched at the upper agency, resulting in the deaths of over 1,000 people, destruction of property worth millions of dollars, and leaving 30,000 people homeless. The Chippewas are also suspected of assuming a warlike attitude, and Indian Agent Walker attempts to arrest the Chippewa chief, Hole-in-the-day, who has gone into hiding with his band.", "The story begins with the description of a sudden and rapid outbreak of violence, driven by the Sioux, against the settlers in the region. The governor, in response to the brutal attacks, calls an emergency session of the legislature to devise a plan to arm and equip volunteers to assist the homeless refugees. The governor's message to the legislature paints a vivid picture of the atrocities committed by the Sioux, including the killing of innocent civilians, rape, and mutilation of bodies.\n\nA notable exception to the brutal behavior of the Sioux is Other Day, a Dakota Indian who has undergone a change of heart and has adopted the habits of civilization. He pilots sixty-two men, women, and children to safety, earning him recognition for his good deed. Other Day attributes his change of heart to his education and his adherence to the teachings of the Great Spirit.\n\nAs the Indian war escalates, the government sends troops under the command of Ex-Gov. Sibley to assemble at St. Peter. However, the troops are poorly armed and equipped, and the people are calling for a more decisive action, echoing the \"On to Richmond!\" cry from the American Civil War. The story then shifts to the siege of Fort Ridgely, where a small garrison of 150 men, led by Lieut. T.J. Sheehan, is surrounded by 700-800 Sioux warriors. The garrison bravely defends the fort for several days, but eventually, relief arrives in the form of about 200 mounted volunteers under Col. McPhail.\n\nAround the same time, the Indians also attack the village of New Ulm, and Judge Charles E. Flandrau organizes a company of volunteers to defend the town. The judge and his men manage to drive the Indians away, but the village is eventually surrounded and burned, with many houses destroyed and several citizens killed. The survivors are forced to evacuate the town and march to Mankato.\n\nAs the conflict escalates, a detail of soldiers and volunteers is sent to bury the dead and rescue the wounded from the battlefields. However, they are ambushed by a large force of Sioux warriors and are forced to defend themselves for two days before relief arrives. The story highlights the bravery and sacrifices of the volunteers and soldiers who risk their lives to protect the innocent civilians and bring order to the region.", "The story is set in St. Paul, Minnesota, during a time of great turmoil and fear. The Sioux, a Native American tribe, had been involved in a series of massacres, killing and wounding many settlers. The news of these disasters reached St. Paul, causing widespread panic and outrage among the citizens. Relatives and friends of the victims denounced the civil and military authorities for their failure to protect the citizens. Home guards were organized, and the bluffs surrounding the city were patrolled to prevent potential attacks from the Sioux.\n\nThe situation was exacerbated by the lack of communication, as there was no telegraph at the time. Rumors spread quickly, and every new arrival from the Minnesota river brought news of fresh outrages. The people of St. Paul were called upon to assist in forwarding refugees to their destinations, and many settlers were forced to abandon their homes. The authorities struggled to provide arms and ammunition to the home guards, making them ill-equipped to face the well-armed Sioux.\n\nGovernor Ramsey attempted to calm the situation by assuring the residents that the Sioux were 80 miles away, but this reassurance was little comfort to the frontiersmen who were forced to flee their homes. A false report of the Sioux's approach to the city caused a panic, with many women and children seeking the protection of the city authorities. However, it was not until the battle of Wood Lake that the people of St. Paul felt safe from the Sioux raids.\n\nGeneral Sibley led an expedition to confront the Sioux, gathering a force of 2,000 men, including the Third regiment and a battery under Captain Mark Hendricks. They marched for several days without encountering opposition before engaging the Sioux near Wood Lake. The battle was a decisive victory for the whites, with four killed and forty or fifty wounded. The Sioux were forced to surrender, and General Sibley's command eventually reached Camp Release, where they liberated a large camp of Indians holding 250 mixed-bloods and white women and children. A military tribunal was formed to try the offenders, resulting in the conviction of 321 Sioux, with 303 sentenced to death and the rest to imprisonment.", "The story revolves around the tumultuous period following the Sioux outbreak in Minnesota. The narrative delves into the complexities of the conflict and its aftermath, highlighting the perspectives of both the government and the Native American community. The story mentions Little Crow, the acknowledged head of the war party, who led the hostile tribes in their struggle against the whites. However, the narrative also notes that he was greatly disliked by many Indians.\n\nThe story takes place in the 1860s, specifically in Minnesota, where the government was dealing with the aftermath of the Sioux outbreak. The president's decision to execute thirty-eight Indians sparked widespread disappointment, and petitions were circulated to have them removed to Massachusetts. The balance of the condemned Indians were kept in close confinement and eventually transported to Davenport and then to a point on the Missouri river. Two prominent Sioux chiefs, Little Six and Medicine Bottle, were arrested at Fort Gary (Winnipeg) and executed in the presence of 10,000 people.\n\nThe narrative also touches on the difficulties faced by the military authorities in transporting supplies to the troops on the frontier. The owners of draft horses were reluctant to lend their teams, leading to the government issuing an order to forcibly impress them into service. A detachment of soldiers was sent to the city to enforce this order, and they seized teams belonging to prominent individuals, including Governor Ramsey.\n\nThe story also highlights the efforts of the ladies of St. Paul, who organized to furnish sick and wounded soldiers with supplies. They collected donations and provided aid to the soldiers and refugees. The narrative also mentions a young man named Hines, who was part of a supply train and claimed to be as brave as Julius Caesar. However, his bravery was put to the test when his companions pretended to be Indians and attacked the train, causing Hines to flee in panic.\n\nThe Sioux's actions ultimately led to them losing their lands in Minnesota, amounting to 750,000 acres, worth approximately $15,000,000. The story concludes with a brief history of the St. Paul Fire Department, but it is not directly related to the main narrative.", "The story begins with a nostalgic poem by Gus Williams, reminiscing about the joy of running with an old machine, likely a reference to early fire engines. The narrative then shifts to a historical account of the development of fire extinguishing instruments in Europe, dating back over three hundred years. It describes the introduction of water tanks, hoses, and suction pipes, highlighting the evolution of fire engines in Amsterdam and England in the 17th century.\n\nAs the story progresses, it transitions to the United States, where bucket fire departments were established in the early 19th century. The New York volunteer fire department was a prominent institution, with annual parades attracting visitors from surrounding towns. However, the narrative notes that these volunteer departments were often more concerned with showmanship than actual firefighting, with members often returning to their quarters for a beer after a false alarm.\n\nIn St. Paul, the city fathers passed an ordinance in 1850 requiring building owners to provide fire buckets, and R.C. Knox organized the first fire brigade in 1851. Two public-spirited citizens, John McCloud and Thompson Ritchie, brought the first fire engine to the city in the Northwest. In 1854, the Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 was formed, with John McCloud as its driving force. The company's constitution and by-laws were adopted, and members were excused from jury duty and other civic responsibilities in exchange for their services.\n\nThe Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company was a prominent institution in St. Paul, with many notable citizens among its members. However, the company faced financial difficulties and was eventually taken over by the city. The city purchased two new fire engines and cisterns, which were tested and deemed satisfactory. A.D. Martin, a member of the company, was known for his enthusiasm and his tendency to declare his intention to kill an Irishman after each fire, although he never succeeded.\n\nIn 1857, the Hope Engine Company No. 1 was organized, and they petitioned the city for new equipment. The company was given possession of a new engine and hose, and they established their headquarters in a new brick building. The story highlights the development of fire departments in St. Paul, from the early volunteer efforts to the establishment of a paid fire department.", "In the mid-19th century, the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, was rapidly growing, and its fire department was formed to protect the community. The story begins with the formation of the Minnehaha Engine Company No. 2 in the winter of 1857-1858, led by H.P. Grant as foreman, with M.J. O'Connor and H.B. Terwilliger as assistants. The company's engine house was located near the corner of Third and Jackson streets and served as a social hub for its members. Other notable fire companies, such as the Rotary Independent Company No. 1 and Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1, were also established during this time.\n\nThe fire department's annual parade was a significant event, attracting 175 men from the four participating companies. The city's churches were also involved in the fire alarm system, with sextons ringing their bells to alert the community of a fire. The fire department's volunteers were known for their bravery and were often aided by the public in battling blazes. However, the outbreak of the war led to a significant decline in the department's ranks as many firefighters enlisted to serve their country.\n\nIn 1858, the legislature passed a law requiring church bells to ring for 15 minutes whenever they received a fire alarm. This led to a chaotic situation, with people rushing to and from different parts of the city, trying to locate the source of the fire. The fire department was often overwhelmed, and the police had to intervene to maintain order.\n\nThe arrival of the first steamer in 1866 marked a significant change in the fire department. The new engine was initially lodged with Hope Engine Company, but the boys took issue with the selection of the engineer and disbanded the company, leading to the formation of St. Paul Hose Company No. 1. The city's rapid growth necessitated the frequent purchase of new fire apparatus, and by the present time, the St. Paul fire department had 211 paid men, 15 steamers, and other equipment.\n\nThe story also highlights the contributions of notable individuals, including Mrs. Bartlett Presley, who provided food and support to the firemen, and the Hon. Michael E. Ames, a lawyer who was known for his punctiliousness and imperturbability. The story also mentions several hotel fires that occurred during this period, including the Daniels house, Sintominie hotel, and others, which were significant events in the city's history.", "The story revolves around the history of fires in St. Paul, particularly in the mid-to-late 19th century. The narrative begins with a mention of Bartlett Presley and W.M. Stees, two firemen who helped save furniture during an unspecified fire. The Sintominie hotel, constructed by C.W. Borup, was destroyed by fire, as were the Rice house, the Canada house, and the Galena house.\n\nOne of the most destructive fires occurred on March 16, 1860, when nearly all the buildings on Third street from Robert to Jackson were destroyed, with only three buildings remaining, including a four-story brick building owned by A.L. Larpenteur. The New England hotel, a historic landmark, and the Empire saloon, which housed the first printing office of the territory, were among the ruins. The Hotel to the Wild Hunter was also destroyed in this fire.\n\nIn 1862, the Winslow house, a four-story brick building constructed by J.M. Winslow in 1854, was destroyed by a fire caused by a defective stovepipe. The proprietors were arrested for incendarism but were later discharged. The American house, a landmark hotel built in 1849, was destroyed by fire in 1863, with thieves making off with jewelry and clothing belonging to guests.\n\nThe Cosmopolitan hotel, built by Mackubin & Edgerton in 1856, was destroyed by fire, and a nearby frame building occupied by Dr. Schell was crushed by falling walls. The doctor was rescued and, despite being under the rubble, was able to speak out against the city authorities for their lax enforcement of the law. In 1868, the Emmert house, a boarding house, was destroyed by fire, and a family with smallpox was rescued by two courageous firemen.\n\nThroughout the narrative, the story highlights the repeated destruction of buildings in St. Paul due to fires, as well as the resilience of the city and its residents. The story also touches on the lives of key individuals, including hotel owners, firemen, and a physician, who are woven into the larger narrative of the city's history.", "In the mid-19th century, St. Paul experienced several devastating hotel fires that left lasting impacts on the city and its residents. The first notable event occurred in 1866 when a guest, Hawkes, accidentally shot and killed his wife at a hotel. He was later acquitted after a long and sensational trial. \n\nIn 1869, a massive fire broke out at the International hotel, which was situated on the northeast corner of Seventh and Jackson streets. The hotel, built by A.G. Fuller in 1856, was a five-story brick structure that had been the headquarters of prominent figures such as William H. Seward and General Pope during the war against the Sioux. The fire started in the basement, believed to be caused by a lamp in the laundry, and spread rapidly due to strong winds and a lack of water supply. Despite the chaos, the night watchman, Pete O'Brien, played a crucial role in ensuring the safe evacuation of over 200 guests, including several notable individuals like General C.C. Andrews, Judge Lochren, and Dr. W.W. Mayo.\n\nThe city's hotel scene continued to face challenges, with the Park Place hotel on the corner of Summit avenue and St. Peter street being burned down in 1878. The fire was suspected to be the work of incendiaries, and four firemen were seriously injured in the process. The Carpenter house, built by Warren Carpenter, also faced a similar fate in 1879, after it had been struggling financially due to the panic of 1857 and the Civil War.\n\nOther significant hotel fires occurred at the Greenman house, the Central house, and the Merchants hotel, which was the only one still standing in name by the end of the 19th century. The Greenman house, situated on the corner of Fifth and St. Peter streets, was a three-story frame structure that was built in the early 1870s. The Central house, located on the corner of Bench and Minnesota streets, was the first hotel of any pretension built in the city and hosted the first session of the territorial legislature of Minnesota.\n\nThe fires had a significant impact on the city's infrastructure and its residents, highlighting the need for improved fire safety measures and emergency response systems. Despite the challenges, the city continued to grow and evolve, with new hotels and buildings emerging to replace the ones that had been lost.", "The story revolves around the history of St. Paul, Minnesota, its early amusement halls, and notable individuals who contributed to the city's culture. The narrative begins with a tragic event where a fire in a three-story building on Third street, near Seven Corners, engulfs a tailor shop owned by Charles and August Mueller, causing them to jump from the top floor to escape. Miraculously, both brothers survive and recover from their ordeal.\n\nThe story then shifts to the early days of St. Paul's amusement halls, specifically Irvine Hall, where Dan Emmet's minstrel company performed in 1857 and 1858. The troupe included notable performers like Frank Lombard, Max Irwin, and Johnny Ritter. Dan Emmet, a talented minstrel and songwriter, went on to achieve national recognition for his compositions, including \"Dixie,\" which became the national air of the Confederate States. Emmet's brother, Lafayette S. Emmett, was a chief justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court, and the two brothers had a close but complicated relationship.\n\nThe Hutchinson family, known for their patriotic songs, often visited St. Paul and performed at various venues. During the Civil War, their abolitionist sentiments led to them being ordered out of the Army of the Potomac by General George McClellan. The family's songs, including \"John Brown's Body,\" became popular among the soldiers, and the melody was later adopted by the North as a rallying cry. General McClellan, who was once idolized by the army and the American people, had a personal connection to St. Paul, having made frequent visits to see his future wife, Miss Marcy, a resident of the city.\n\nThe story also touches on the lives of notable individuals in St. Paul, including the city's fire chiefs, such as Wash M.

The narrative jumps between various events, places, and characters, providing a glimpse into the lives of the city's residents and visitors.\n\nThe story begins with a mention of the Hutchinson family, who were prominent concert-givers in pre-Civil War times. John W. Hutchinson, the last surviving member of the family, is celebrating his 81st birthday and has just started a new crusade against cigarette sales. He is a wealthy and accomplished singer, having written many songs, including \"The Blue and the Gray\" and \"Good Times for Women,\" which he sang in Atlanta during the exposition.\n\nThe story then shifts to the Athenaeum, a concert hall built in 1859 by the German Reading Society, which was the only amusement hall in St. Paul with a stage and drop curtain at the time. The hall hosted various performances, including dramatic and musical events for the boys in blue during the war. Notable performers who took part in these events include Prof. Phil Roher, Otto Dreher, and Susan Denin.\n\nThe narrative also touches on the lives of other notable figures, such as Tom Marshall, a renowned orator from Kentucky, who was struggling with the effects of excessive drinking. Marshall was known for his eloquence and was invited to speak at a Democratic gathering, where he delivered a scathing speech against Douglas and the Democratic party.\n\nAnother notable event mentioned in the story is the presidential election of 1860, where a group of musicians gathered at a concert hall to entertain the Republicans awaiting election returns.

Wallack, prominent actors who performed in \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" and \"Macbeth,\" which received great acclaim from the audience. Another notable figure, Col. R.E.J. Miles, produced his play \"Mazeppa\" at the theater, which later brought him fame.\n\nMazurka hall, located on the southeast corner of Third and Exchange streets, was a popular spot for social events, including a ball where J.Q.A. Ward met Miss Pratt, leading to a hasty marriage. The hall was also home to Napoleon Heitz's saloon and restaurant, where he regaled patrons with stories of his experiences in battles under Napoleon.\n\nIn 1860, Charles N. Mackubin built Mozart hall and Masonic hall on the site of the Metropolitan hotel. These halls were later used for a sanitary fair in 1864, where a spirited contest between Col. Uline and Col. Marshall took place, with Col. Uline ultimately winning a sword for receiving over two thousand votes.\n\nThe city also celebrated Washington's birthday with grand processions and elaborate exercises, which included performances by the Pioneer Guards, the City Guards, and the St. Paul Light Artillery. In 1857, the renowned singer Adalina Patti made her debut in St. Paul with the Ole Bull Concert company, performing in the hall of the old capitol.\n\nThroughout the story, various individuals and groups played significant roles in shaping the city's entertainment and social scene. These characters, including H. Van Liew, Col. R.E.J. Miles, J.Q.A. Ward, and Adalina Patti, contributed to the rich cultural tapestry of St. Paul during this period.", "The story is set in St. Paul, Minnesota, in the mid-to-late 19th century, during the American Civil War era. The narrative begins with a glimpse into the past, where two kids who were involved in a careless incident are now adults, living in fear of being caught and facing severe consequences, including imprisonment and years of servitude in Stillwater.\n\nThe story then shifts to a mass meeting at the hall of the house of representatives, where citizens gather to express their outrage at the Cotton States' attempt to disrupt the government. The meeting is presided over by Hon. John S. Prince, with Hon. John M. Gilman and Hon. J.W. Taylor delivering speeches in support of the government and President Lincoln. The citizens pledge their support, promising to aid the war effort and provide financial assistance to the families of those who have left to fight.\n\nIn the following years, the state of Minnesota is admitted into the Union, and the first Republican state convention is held. Col. Aldrich and William Windom are elected as representatives in congress, with Col. Aldrich promising to work hard to promote the success of the ticket.\n\nThe narrative also touches on the social scene in St. Paul, including the annual ball of the Pioneer Guards, a prestigious social event that was attended by the city's elite. However, some members of the group joined the Confederate forces, including Col. Wilkin Col. King and Capt. Coates. The story also mentions the construction of the old opera house, which was later replaced by the Grand opera house.\n\nThe narrative also highlights the city's cultural scene, including the performances of famous speakers such as Frederick Douglass, who was met with a standing ovation, and the mock prize fight between James J. Hill and Theodore Borup, which was attended by a large crowd.\n\nThe story also lists a number of printers and editors who were active in the territorial days, including E.Y. Shelly, who was a pioneer printer in Minnesota, and several others who were involved in the Civil War.", "In the early 1840s, Minnesota was a new territory, and the pioneers who settled there were in need of a way to communicate the region's advantages to the outside world. Among these pioneers were a group of printers who played a crucial role in bringing the news to the masses. One such printer, James M. Goodhue, arrived in St. Paul in 1849 with a Washington hand press and a few fonts of type, aiming to start a paper at the capital of the new territory. He was soon joined by other printers, including two young men, Ditmarth and Dempsey, who were the first to set foot on the site of what would become the metropolis of the Northwest. However, they soon left, and Goodhue's party was later joined by a young man named Capt. E.Y. Shelly.\n\nCapt. Shelly, born in Pennsylvania in 1827, had previously served in the Mexican-American War as a member of the Third United States Dragoons. He was part of the battles of Palo Alto, Monterey, and Buena Vista, where the American forces were successful against the Mexicans. After the war, Shelly arrived in St. Paul in 1849 and became the first printer to permanently locate in Minnesota. He worked at various newspapers, including the Register, the Pioneer, and the Daily Democrat, where he was employed by Mr. Goodhue at the time of his death.\n\nIn 1861, when President Lincoln called for men to suppress the rebellion, Capt. Shelly's old patriotism was rekindled, and he organized a company, known as Brackett's battalion, along with Major Brackett. The battalion consisted of three Minnesota companies and was mustered into service in September 1861. They were assigned to the Fifth Iowa cavalry and played a crucial role in the attack and surrender of Fort Donelson in February 1862. Capt. Shelly's company was part of the regiment that prevented the rebel Gen. Buckner from receiving reinforcements, and they later protected the railroad from Columbus, Ky., to Corinth, Miss.\n\nThroughout the war, Capt. Shelly's company was engaged in various battles, including the Battle of Chickamauga, where they took a prominent part. After the battle, they were kept on duty on the dividing line between the two forces. In 1864, they received orders to report to Gen. Sully at Sioux City, who was preparing to make a final campaign against the rebellious Sioux. The expedition marched over 3,000 miles, encountering Indians and routing them, and eventually returned to Fort Ridgley in the fall. Capt. Shelly was mustered out of the service in the spring of 1865 and returned to his profession as a printer.", "The story revolves around the lives of several printers and journalists who played significant roles in the American Civil War and the early days of Minnesota's printing industry. The narrative begins by highlighting the military careers of these individuals, who enlisted in various regiments, including the Pioneer Guards, First and Second Minnesota regiments, and Berdan's sharpshooters. These soldiers distinguished themselves in battles like Gettysburg and served in different capacities, such as officers, quartermasters, and correspondents.\n\nAmong the notable individuals is Charles R. Stuart, a renowned compositor who claimed to be a descendant of the royal house of Stuart. He set a record for setting 26,000 ems of type in 24 hours and was known for his exceptional speed and skill. Stuart enlisted in the Eighth regiment and served as a lieutenant before returning home and publishing a paper in Sault Ste Marie. Another skilled compositor, E.S. Lightbourn, served three years in the Seventh Minnesota and later became the foreman of the Pioneer.\n\nThe story also introduces several other printers and journalists who made significant contributions to the printing industry in Minnesota. J.M. Clum, a member of Company D, Second Minnesota, took part in several battles and later became one of the oldest printers in St. Paul. J.B. Chancy, who came to Minnesota before the state's admission to the Union, was a member of Berdan's sharpshooters and later became a publisher in Michigan. M.R. Prendergast, although not directly connected to the printing business, was an old-time printer who served in the Tenth Minnesota during the rebellion.\n\nThe narrative also delves into the lives of these individuals after the war, highlighting their achievements in the printing industry and beyond. George W. Moore, who formed a partnership with John P. Owens in the publication of the Minnesotian, later became the collector of the port of St. Paul under President Lincoln. Louis E. Fisher, a foreman of the Commercial Advertiser, was a democratic candidate for governor and a staunch believer in Jeffersonian simplicity. The story concludes by mentioning several other notable printers, including James Mills, O.G. Miller, and George W. Armstrong, who made significant contributions to the printing industry and their communities.", "The narrative revolves around the lives of various individuals associated with the printing industry in the Northwest, primarily in St. Paul, during the late 19th century. The story highlights the personalities and experiences of these individuals, including David Ramaley, a renowned printer, reporter, editor, and type founder; H.O. Bassford, a skilled compositor; Francis P. McNamee, a printer, reporter, and editor with a delicate constitution; and George W. Benedict, the editor and publisher of the Sauk Rapids Sentinel.\n\nThe text also mentions several other notable figures in the printing industry, such as Richard Bradley, the foreman of the job department at the St. Paul Times; D.L. Paine, the author of the famous poem \"Who Stole Ben Johnson's Spaces\"; and John O. Terry, the first hand pressman in St. Paul. The story also touches on the lives of lesser-known individuals, including J.B.H. Mitchell, a compositor who later became a farmer in Northern Minnesota; Andrew Jackson Morgan, a printer-politician who resembled Stephen A. Douglas; and Jack Ward, the business manager of the Minnesotian.\n\nThe narrative also delves into the social dynamics of the printing industry, where editors and printers often worked and slept in the same room due to meager hotel accommodations. This led to a sense of camaraderie and sociability among the individuals, which often extended to their work. The story highlights the close relationships between editors and printers, with many individuals holding multiple positions within the industry.\n\nThe text also provides anecdotes about the personal lives of these individuals, including their hobbies and interests. For instance, William Jebb, a debater and reporter, was known for raising blooded chickens and was the victim of a theft that led to a humorous article in the St. Paul Times. The narrative also mentions the mistakes and mishaps of young printer-reporters, such as a scurrilous biography of Washington and articles that offended various nationalities.\n\nThe story concludes with a mention of the old Press removing from Bridge Square in 1869 to a new building, where Earle S. Goodrich, the editor-in-chief of the Pioneer, set the first type in the new building, only to discover an error in the first line of his article. The narrative provides a glimpse into the lives and experiences of individuals associated with the printing industry in the Northwest during this period, highlighting their personalities, relationships, and contributions to the industry.", "The Second Minnesota Regiment, led by Colonel H.P. Van Cleve, was formed in response to the outbreak of the war in 1861. The regiment's formation was swift, with nearly two regiments volunteering at the president's call, and it was eventually made up of ten companies with a few additions. The regiment was initially stationed at Fort Snelling, but was later ordered to report to General W.T. Sherman in Louisville, Kentucky. \n\nUpon arriving in Louisville, the regiment was organized into a brigade with the Eighteenth United States infantry, Ninth and Thirty-fifth Ohio regiments, under the command of General George H. Thomas. In January 1862, the brigade participated in the Mill Springs campaign, a series of marches under harsh weather conditions. The Second Minnesota was stationed near Zollicoffer's intrenched rebel camp at Beech Grove, where they were on picket duty on the night of January 18.\n\nThe following morning, the rebel advance struck the Union pickets, and a fierce battle ensued. The Second Minnesota, along with the Ninth Ohio, played a crucial role in the engagement, using the bayonet and displaying heroic conduct. Despite being outnumbered nearly three to one, the Union forces emerged victorious, capturing twelve rebel cannon, caissons, and wagons, as well as large quantities of ammunition and supplies. The Confederate forces, led by General Zollicoffer, suffered significant losses, including the death of their commander.\n\nThe battle of Mill Springs marked a turning point in the war, breaking up the Confederate right flank and opening a way into East Tennessee. The Union victory also forced the withdrawal of General Albert Sidney Johnston's troops from Bowling Green, Kentucky. The Second Minnesota Regiment suffered twelve casualties and thirty-five wounded, while the Confederate forces lost 600 in killed, wounded, and prisoners. The heroic conduct of the Second Minnesota was widely praised, and their actions were seen as a significant blow to the Confederate army's morale. The battle also highlighted the bravery and determination of the Union soldiers, who fought against overwhelming odds to secure a crucial victory.", "The story revolves around the American Civil War, specifically the battles fought by the Union army in the Southwest. The narrative begins with the Battle of Mill Springs, where General Felix Zollicoffer, a prominent citizen of Nashville, led the Confederate forces against the Union forces. However, he was killed by Colonel Fry, a Union officer, after a stranger in civilian clothes approached him, claiming that the Union troops were firing on their own men. This event was celebrated by the loyal Kentuckians, who saw it as a victory against the rebel invaders from Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n\nThe story then shifts to the Second Minnesota Infantry Regiment, which had arrived in Louisville on February 24, 1862. The regiment was welcomed by the loyal ladies, who presented them with a silk flag as a token of appreciation for their bravery. The regiment had previously fought in battles such as Bull Run and Ball's Bluff, and their heroism was recognized by the Minnesota legislature, which passed a joint resolution praising their bravery.\n\nThe narrative then moves on to the Battle of Pittsburg Landing, fought on April 6-7, 1862. This battle was one of the most devastating of the Civil War, with a terrible loss of life. The Union army, led by General Ulysses S. Grant, was trying to prevent the Confederate army, led by General Albert Sidney Johnston, from destroying them before the arrival of General Buell's Army of the Cumberland. However, General Buell's delay in arriving at the scene resulted in a significant loss of life. General Grant was suspended from his command by General Halleck, but was later restored to his position.\n\nThe story highlights the complex relationships and power struggles between the Union generals, including General Grant, General Halleck, and General Buell. General Grant's popularity and success in battles such as Fort Henry and Fort Donelson made his superiors jealous, leading to accusations of disloyalty and suspension from his command. However, General Grant's career ultimately proved the wisdom of General Sherman's entreaty to remain in his position.", "The Battle of Pittsburg Landing, also known as the Battle of Shiloh, was a pivotal event in the American Civil War. The Union army under the command of General Ulysses S. Grant was stationed at Pittsburg Landing, a semi-circular formation with its right flank resting on Crump's Landing, the center near the road to Corinth, and the left extending towards Harrisburg. The Union forces were comprised of raw recruits, some of whom had never heard the sound of musketry before.\n\nOn the morning of the battle, a small reconnaissance party of 400 men from Colonel Prentiss' division was sent to investigate a potential threat. However, they were ambushed by a large rebel force, and after a fierce resistance, they retreated in good order. At around 6 o'clock, the enemy drove in the pickets of General Sherman's division and attacked three Ohio regiments, resulting in a severe slaughter. The Union forces were initially in disarray, with many stragglers fleeing the battlefield.\n\nGeneral Grant, who had been dispatched from Savannah, arrived on the scene and took charge, ordering a strong guard to be placed across the thoroughfare to prevent further retreat. By 10 o'clock, the entire line on both sides was engaged in a fierce battle, with the roar of cannons and musketry filling the air. The Union forces, however, were able to hold their ground, and by 5 o'clock, the enemy lines had fallen back on the center for a brief respite.\n\nThe rebel forces, determined to make a final push, launched a vigorous attack on the left wing, but were met with fierce resistance from the Union forces. The arrival of the gunboats Tyler and Lexington, which had taken up positions above the river landing, provided crucial support to the Union forces. The gunboats poured shells into the rebel lines, causing significant casualties and forcing them to retreat. As night began to fall, the rebels fell back, fighting as they went, and eventually occupied a position near the road to Corinth. The battle had been a severe disappointment to the rebel leaders, who had expected to annihilate Grant's army and cross the Tennessee River.\n\nThe battle was a testament to the bravery and determination of the Union forces, who had fought against overwhelming odds and emerged victorious. Despite suffering heavy losses, the Union army had held its ground and prevented the rebels from achieving their objectives. The battle marked a significant turning point in the war, and it would have far-reaching consequences for the outcome of the conflict.", "The story revolves around the Battle of Shiloh, a pivotal event in the American Civil War, fought between the Union forces led by General Ulysses S. Grant and the Confederate forces under General Albert Sidney Johnston. The battle took place in April 1862, with the Union army aiming to march through Tennessee, Kentucky, and into Ohio. However, their initial plan was unsuccessful due to General Grant's slow pace, which allowed the Confederates to regroup and reinforce their positions.\n\nGeneral Albert Sidney Johnston, the Confederate commander, was killed in the first day's battle while attempting to lead an unsuccessful charge. The Union forces, led by Generals Grant, Buell, Nelson, and Crittenden, were initially slow to respond, with General Buell taking 19 days to march 85 miles from Columbia, Tennessee, to the Tennessee River. Despite being ordered to join forces with Grant's army as soon as possible, Buell's delay gave the Confederates time to regroup and strengthen their defenses.\n\nOn the first day of the battle, the Union forces faced heavy resistance, with the hardest fighting taking place in front of the divisions of Sherman and McClernand. General Prentiss was captured, along with 2,200 of his men, and General W.H.L. Wallace was killed. The Union forces suffered heavy casualties, with over 1,700 killed, 8,400 wounded, and 2,800 missing. The Confederates also suffered significant losses, with over 10,600 casualties.\n\nOn the second day of the battle, the Union forces, reinforced by General Lew Wallace's division, launched a decisive attack against the Confederate forces. The Union artillery played a crucial role, with a powerful battery stationed on an open field pouring volley after volley into the rebel ranks. The Confederates began to retreat, and the Union forces pursued them, with General Grant leading the charge. The battle was finally won, with the Confederates retreating to their fortified position at Corinth.\n\nThe story also highlights the contributions of the First Minnesota Battery, a light artillery unit that played a crucial role in the battle. The battery was organized in the fall of 1861 and saw action in several key battles, including the Battle of Pittsburg Landing, the siege of Vicksburg, and the march from Atlanta to the sea.", "The story revolves around the life and death of Captain William Henry Acker, a brave and patriotic soldier from St. Paul, Minnesota. Born in New York State in 1833, Acker moved to St. Paul in 1854 and started his career as a lawyer before joining the Bank of Minnesota. He also served as the captain of the Pioneer Guards, a military organization, and later as the commander of the Wide-Awakes, a marching club that supported Abraham Lincoln's presidential campaign. When the news of the Civil War broke out, Acker resigned as the adjutant general of Minnesota and organized a company for the First Minnesota regiment, where he was appointed captain.\n\nIn the first battle of Bull Run, Acker was wounded and later made captain in the Seventeenth United States Regulars. However, he was killed in action on April 6, 1862, during the battle at Pittsburg Landing. Acker's company was part of the First Minnesota regiment, which was attached to General Prentiss' division of Grant's army. The regiment was transferred to a new position on an elevated piece of ground, where they repelled several rebel attacks with their artillery, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the First Minnesota regiment held their ground, but Acker was fatally shot by a rebel sharpshooter while leading his company.\n\nThe news of Acker's death was met with shock and grief in St. Paul, and his body was later recovered and brought back to the city for a grand funeral. The event was attended by thousands of citizens, and the respect shown to Acker's memory was a testament to his popularity and bravery. The first Grand Army post in St. Paul was later named after him, and the story of his life and death became an inspiration to many. In contrast, the story also mentions the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, which occurred on April 15, 1865, and was met with immense shock and grief across the nation.", "The story begins by describing a somber atmosphere in the United States following the assassination of President Lincoln, which is deeply felt in St. Paul. The city is in mourning, with all public and private buildings draped in mourning, and memorial services are held at the House of Hope church, where the Rev. Frederick A. Noble delivers a eulogy. The pastor, a renowned and eloquent divine, had been a strong supporter of the Union cause and believed in the justness of the war effort.\n\nAs the story shifts to an allegorical horoscope, a voyageur from the North Star State embarks on a mission of peace and good will to the red men of the distant forest. He encounters a paleface, Robert, who is about to become the mighty chief of a great metropolis. The dusky maiden, an astrologer, foretells Robert's destiny, predicting that he will live a long and uninterrupted reign, but must navigate the complexities of politics by avoiding taking strong convictions and instead, using his discretion to maintain the support of various groups. The Okons, a powerful family of Irish nobility, are also mentioned as crucial allies who will aid Robert in his administration.\n\nThe story then jumps forward in time, nearly a century later, to the same region, where the voyageur has returned to find a transformed landscape. The city of St. Paul has grown into a magnificent metropolis, with steamers and electricity transforming the landscape. Robert, now the ruler of the city, is supported by the Okons, who hold positions of power. The narrative suggests that Robert's ability to maintain balance and avoid controversy has allowed him to achieve his goals, but at the cost of compromising his convictions.\n\nThe story thus far has presented a non-linear narrative, jumping between the somber atmosphere of the post-Lincoln assassination era and the allegorical horoscope, which foretells the future of Robert, a paleface who will become the ruler of a great city. The narrative has introduced key characters, such as the Rev. Frederick A. Noble and Robert, as well as the Okons, a powerful family of Irish nobility. The story has also highlighted the themes of politics, power, and the complexities of leadership.", "The story is a narrative that spans multiple timelines and settings, blending historical events with personal anecdotes.

The narrator's school had a weekly spelling match and recitation, which took place on Saturday nights, and every four weeks, the schools would meet for a grand spelling contest.\n\nThe narrator, eager to participate in the spelling contest, managed to sneak onto a sleigh carrying other students to a contest at a country crossroads. He took his place in the lineup, and when the school-master from his district pronounced the word \"phthisic,\" the narrator saw an opportunity to demonstrate his skills. He correctly spelled the word, impressing the school-master and the other students, and his name was forever etched as the champion speller.\n\nThe narrative then jumps to a different time period, where Frank Moore, a man who had been working at the Pioneer Press for fifty years, is being celebrated for his service. Born in Tioga county, Pennsylvania, Moore started working at the Minnesotian at the age of fifteen, carrying water for the office and meeting boats to collect newspapers.

The city's early newspapers, such as the Pioneer and the Minnesotian, were small operations with limited resources, employing a single pressman, a few compositors, two editors, and a business manager. The industry's growth was hindered by the lack of modern technology, with a single hand press capable of producing only 240 impressions per hour. The Minnesotian, in particular, was a notable newspaper that played a significant role in the city's journalism scene.\n\nIn 1857, a constitutional convention was held in Minnesota, and the Minnesotian was awarded the contract to print the proceedings of the Democratic convention. However, the Pioneer, led by state printer Mr. Goodrich, claimed the right to print the proceedings of both conventions, leading to a court case that ultimately favored the Minnesotian. The Minnesotian's business manager, Mr. Moore, was able to distribute $4,000 to his employees after the court's decision. This event marked a significant milestone for the Minnesotian, establishing its reputation as a prominent newspaper in the city.\n\nThe city's residents eagerly awaited news of the successful laying of the Atlantic cable in 1858, with two steamboats, the Gray Eagle and the Itasca, racing to bring the news to St. Paul.
