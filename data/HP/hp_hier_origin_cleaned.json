{"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone": "Harry James Potter, an 11-year-old boy, lives with his cruel relatives, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and their spoiled son Dudley. Harry is unaware that he is a wizard, the son of famous wizards Lily and James Potter, who were killed by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort. However, Harry survived a deadly curse from Voldemort when he was a baby, and the dark wizard's spell backfired, leaving him nearly destroyed.\n\nHarry receives a mysterious letter from Rubeus Hagrid, the giant Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hagrid informs Harry that he has been accepted to Hogwarts and will be trained as a wizard. Harry boards the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross Station, accessing Platform 9\u00be through a magical barrier. He meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger on the train, forming a close-knit trio.\n\nAt Hogwarts, Harry discovers that Nicolas Flamel created the Philosopher's Stone, a powerful object granting eternal life. The stone's existence attracts attention, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione begin to suspect that someone at Hogwarts is searching for it. They encounter the stone's protection in the form of a three-headed dog, Fluffy, and a series of magical obstacles designed to safeguard the stone. However, it is revealed that Quirrell is secretly working for Lord Voldemort, attempting to use the Philosopher's Stone's powers to regain a physical body and become immortal.\n\nHarry thwarts Voldemort's attempt to steal the stone, but Quirrell dies in the process. In the aftermath, Professor Dumbledore explains to Harry that his survival is due to the love his mother, Lily Potter, had for him. This selfless love is a powerful magic that Voldemort cannot understand or overcome."}
