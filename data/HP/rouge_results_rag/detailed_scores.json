    "candidate": "Harry James Potter, an 11-year-old boy, lives with his cruel aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and their spoiled son Dudley in a small cupboard under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive in Little Whinging, England. Harry is treated harshly by the Dursleys, who belittle him, make him feel unwanted, and force him to take the blame for any trouble that happens in the house.\n\nOn his 11th birthday, Harry receives his first letter from Rubeus Hagrid, the giant Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, informing him that he has been accepted to Hogwarts and will be trained as a wizard. Hagrid reveals that Harry is famous in the wizarding world as the boy who survived Voldemort's deadly curse, making him an object of awe and reverence.\n\nHarry boards the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross Station's Platform 9\u00be, a hidden platform accessible only to wizards and witches. On the train, he meets Ron Weasley, a kind-hearted and loyal friend from a large wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a bright and determined young witch from a non-magical family.\n\nThe trio eventually confronts Quirrell, who reveals his true intentions and is possessed by Voldemort's spirit. The story highlights the corrupting influence of power and greed, as Quirrell is consumed by Voldemort's dark magic, ultimately leading to a terrifying confrontation between Harry and Voldemort.\n\nIn the final confrontation, Harry faces Quirrell, who has become a sinister force driven by his loyalty to Voldemort. Harry's instinctive understanding of his mother's love and protection ultimately leads to Quirrell's disintegration, and the Philosopher's Stone is secured, thwarting Voldemort's plans for the time being.\n\nAs the year comes to a close, Harry reflects on what he's learned and experienced, realizing that he has a place in the world, a family in his friends, and a destiny that is greater than he could have imagined. Harry's thoughts, however, linger on the dangers that still lie ahead, knowing that Voldemort is not truly gone and that he will have to face the dark wizard again in the future.",
    "reference": "The story begins with Harry Potter, an 11-year-old boy who lives a miserable life with his cruel aunt, uncle, and cousin, the Dursleys. Harry is forced to live in a cupboard under the stairs, treated poorly by the Dursleys, who deny him any affection or love. Harry is unaware of his true identity, including the fact that he is a wizard and the survivor of an attack by the dark wizard Voldemort. His parents, Lily and James Potter, were killed by Voldemort, but Harry miraculously survived, leaving him with a lightning-shaped scar and making him a symbol of hope in the wizarding world.\nHarry's life changes when he receives an invitation to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on his 11th birthday. Rubeus Hagrid, a giant and Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts, arrives to tell Harry that he is a wizard and that his parents were famous in the magical world. Harry learns that Voldemort attempted to kill him as a baby, but Harry\u2019s survival left Voldemort nearly destroyed.\nAt Hogwarts, Harry makes friends with Ron Weasley, from a large wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a brilliant witch. The trio discovers the mystery surrounding the Philosopher's Stone, a magical object capable of granting immortality. They uncover that the stone is hidden at Hogwarts, guarded by a three-headed dog named Fluffy. As they investigate further, they realize that someone at the school is trying to steal the stone, and they face various magical challenges to prevent this from happening.\nEventually, they discover that the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Quirrell, is serving as a host for Voldemort's weakened form. Quirrell seeks the Philosopher's Stone to restore Voldemort to power. Harry confronts Quirrell in the final chamber and, using the magical protection bestowed by his mother\u2019s sacrifice, prevents Voldemort from obtaining the stone.\nThe book concludes with Harry returning to the Dursleys, but now with a newfound sense of belonging and hope, as well as the knowledge that he has a greater destiny to fulfill. The lessons of friendship, loyalty, and love guide him, preparing him for future challenges.",
