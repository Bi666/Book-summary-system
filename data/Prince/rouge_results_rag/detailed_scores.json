However, as Elara stands by her palace balcony, she feels the weight of destiny pressing on her shoulders and begins to doubt the prophecy.\n\nElara's trusted advisor, Lady Seraphine, reveals whispers of betrayal, suggesting that their union is not just a union of love, but a political maneuver that could bring forth a new era of darkness.
