{"reminiscences-of-pioneer-days-in-st-paul": ["The story \"REMINISCENCES OF PIONEER DAYS IN ST. PAUL\" by FRANK MOORE is a collection of articles written for and published in the Daily Pioneer Press. The narrative begins with a description of the advancements in newspaper production technology in the latter half of the 19th century, comparing the old hand press to the new web-perfecting press, which could produce 25,000 impressions per hour. The story then shifts to the early days of newspaper publishing in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the first daily papers were printed with a small staff, including one pressman, five or six compositors, two editors, and a business manager.\n\nIn 1857, an election was held to choose delegates to the constitutional convention, which led to a division between the Republicans and Democrats. The Pioneer and the Minnesotian, the two leading papers of the state, were awarded the contract to print the proceedings of the two conventions. The business manager of the Minnesotian, Mr. Moore, purchased a Hoe press and a large quantity of type, as well as a Hoe proof press, which is still in use in the Pioneer Press composing room. However, the business manager of the Minnesotian was informed that an injunction had been issued prohibiting him from drawing any money from the state until the question of the right of the Minnesotian to do any state printing had been determined by the district court. This caused great consternation in the Minnesotian office, as the employees had not received their pay for some time.\n\nThe district court ultimately decided in favor of the Minnesotian, and Mr. Moore was able to distribute $4,000 to his employees. In 1858, the news of the successful laying of the Atlantic cable was eagerly anticipated, and the Gray Eagle and Itasca boats were expected to bring the news to St. Paul. A messenger from the Minnesotian caught a copy of the Dubuque Herald containing the Queen's message, and the Minnesotian was able to print an extra edition before their competitors.\n\nIn the summer season, newspapers in St. Paul relied on steamboats for late Dubuque and Chicago papers, which carried telegraph news. Messengers from the different offices would wait at the levee for the arrival of the boats, and there was a scramble to get to the clerk's office first. James J. Hill and Gus Borup were often at the levee waiting for the boats' manifest.\n\nThe Minnesotian was the first daily paper in the West to illustrate a local feature, and in 1859, they published a story about a man named Jackson being lynched by a mob in Wright county. The Pioneer Guards, a crack military company, was called out to arrest the individuals involved in the tragedy, but they were unprepared for the task and made their wills before departing. The Minnesotian's city editor, J. Fletcher Williams, wrote an extended account of the expedition, which was profusely illustrated with patent medicine cuts and inverted wood type.\n\nThe year 1859 was a memorable one in the political history of Minnesota, with Alexander Ramsey and George L. Becker as rival candidates for governor. The Republicans made extraordinary efforts to elect their state and legislative tickets, and imported speakers such as Galusha A. Grow and Schuyler Colfax. A speech by Grow was interrupted by an alarm of fire, which destroyed the People's theater, but the morning papers failed to report the incident the next day.", "The story \"REMINISCENCES OF PIONEER DAYS IN ST.

The narrative begins with a description of the advancements in newspaper production technology in the latter half of the 19th century, comparing the old hand press to the new web-perfecting press, which could produce 25,000 impressions per hour. The story then shifts to the early days of newspaper publishing in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the first daily papers were printed with a small staff, including one pressman, five or six compositors, two editors, and a business manager.\n\nIn 1854, the first daily papers, the Pioneer, the Minnesotian, and the Times, began publishing in St. Paul. The two leading papers, the Pioneer and the Minnesotian, were involved in a heated competition to be the first to print the president's message. The proprietor of the Minnesotian once attempted to intercept the mail coach at Red Wing to get ahead of his competitors but ended up receiving a copy of his own paper containing the complete message before returning to St. Paul. As a result, the management of the Minnesotian provided an oyster supper for the employees of the paper that was first to publish the president's message, which often required a week for the typographers to recover from.\n\nDuring this time, the Minnesotian's editor, Dr. Foster, was a powerful figure in the Republican party and was known for his irascible temper and vigorous writing style. He was also a skilled writer and had a reputation for performing dramatic outbursts in the composing room of the Minnesotian. The narrator recalls an instance where Dr. Foster became enraged upon reading the news of President Buchanan's veto of the homestead law, which was passed with the assistance of President Johnson. The Minnesotian was also involved in a telegraph news dispute with the Pioneer, where the two papers agreed not to take dispatches until the rates were lowered, but the Pioneer secretly made a contract with the telegraph company and left the Minnesotian out.\n\nThe story also touches on the economic struggles faced by newspaper employees during this time. Wages were low, and there was no money to speak of. Married men were considered fortunate if they could get an order on a grocery or dry goods store for four or five dollars on Saturday night, while single men received only $2 or $3, which was barely enough to pay their board bill. This state of affairs continued until the Press was started in 1861, when Gov. Marshall inaugurated the custom of paying employees every Saturday night.\n\nIn the summer of 1860, a large party of Republican statesmen and politicians visited St. Paul, including State Senator W.H. Seward, Senator John P. Hale, Charles Francis Adams, and General Stewart L. Woodford. Mr. Seward made a speech from the front steps of the old capitol, predicting that the capitol of the great republic would be located near the Falls of St. Anthony. However, those who were not within earshot of the speech had to wait until the New York Herald arrived in St. Paul to read the report of the speech. The completion of the telegraph line to St. Paul in the fall of 1860 was also significant, as it allowed for faster communication with the rest of the country. However, the charges for telegraph news were so high that the three papers in St. Paul could not afford the luxury of the \"latest news by Associated Press.\"", "The story \"REMINISCENCES OF PIONEER DAYS IN ST.

The Press's telegraph news dispute with the Pioneer was resolved after Gov. Marshall had a stormy interview with Mr. Winslow, resulting in the Press receiving full telegraphic reports. The narrator recalls Gov. Marshall as a noble man who was deeply affected by the news of the first battle of Bull Run, which initially reported a Union victory but later revealed a great reverse, causing the governor to become one of the bravest in battling for his country's honor.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Minnesota sent a large number of men to fight, and although the state met its quota, the draft was necessary in some counties with a large foreign population. The anti-drafters in these counties were bitter, and a riot was feared, but the draft took place without interruption after troops were ordered down from the fort. The Press, which advocated for the vigorous prosecution of the war, faced threats of being mobbed, and a company was organized for self-defense, with Capt. E.R. Otis, a genuine military man, as the post commander.\n\nThe narrator also shares his experience working at the Daily Minnesotian, where he learned about the concept of a \"scoop\" when the Pioneer published the news of Minnesota's admission to the Union before the other papers. The telegraph line was completed in the summer of 1860, but it was not until the summer of 1861 that the Press began to receive regular telegraphic dispatches. The narrator also mentions the early steamboating era, the celebration of the successful laying of the first Atlantic cable, and a fight between the Chippewas and Sioux, which will be discussed later in the story.\n\nThe story also touches on the daily newspapers' expansion during the latter part of the Civil War, which led to the introduction of new technologies such as double-cylinder presses, turtle-back presses, stereotyping, and linotype type-setting machines. The narrator notes that the next great advance will be a system of photography that will entirely dispense with the work of the printer and proofreader.", "In \"REMINISCENCES OF PIONEER DAYS IN ST.

St. Paul's economy relied heavily on steamboat trade, but the Great Panic of 1857 hit the state hard. To combat this, the state proposed the $5 million loan to build railroads, but its implementation was marred by controversy, leading to financial burdens on the state.", "In \"REMINISCENCES OF PIONEER DAYS IN ST.

To combat this, the state proposed the $5 million loan to build railroads, but its implementation was marred by controversy, leading to financial burdens on the state. The city council of St. Paul also played a significant role in supporting the local economy, as seen in their appropriation of several hundred dollars to celebrate the successful laying of the Atlantic cable in 1858.\n\nThe laying of the Atlantic cable was a significant event that led to a grand celebration in St. Paul. The city council's efforts to commemorate this achievement resulted in a grand procession that showcased the city's military, civic, and cultural organizations. The procession featured various floats, including one representing the art of printing, which was designed by George H. Colgrave and featured Miss Azelene Allen, a young actress, as the Goddess of Liberty. Other notable figures, such as Col. AC Jones, the marshal-in-chief, and Miss Rosa Larpenteur, the daughter of A.L. Larpenteur, were also part of the procession. The celebration was a testament to the city's enthusiasm and pride in its achievements.\n\nIn addition to the celebration, the story also touches on the establishment of the Sons of Malta, a secret order that was organized in the Eastern states in the early 1850s. The order's membership grew rapidly, and a lodge was established in St. Paul in 1858. The order's initiation process was elaborate and featured a series of questions that tested the candidate's loyalty and willingness to engage in questionable activities. The story also mentions a visit by a large excursion party from Cincinnati, Chicago, and Milwaukee, which included notable figures such as the elocutionist Alf. Burnett and Gov. Alexander Randall of Wisconsin.", "In the early 1850s, St. Paul, Minnesota, was a growing city, with a newspaper industry emerging in 1854. Dr. Thomas Foster (editor of The Minnesotian) and Maj. Thomas M. Newson (editor of The Times) played key roles in its development. The city's economy struggled due to the Great Panic of 1857 but recovered somewhat with the proposed $5 million loan to build railroads. In 1858, the city council celebrated the successful Atlantic cable laying, featuring a grand procession with various floats and notable figures, such as the Goddess of Liberty, Miss Azelene Allen.\n\nAs a result of these events, St. Paul's economy grew, and new organizations like the Sons of Malta emerged. The city continued to grow with newspaper consolidations, new publications, and notable events like President Lincoln's 1862 call for volunteer reinforcements.", "During the American Civil War, the nation faced numerous challenges, including a Southern rebellion and the threat of foreign intervention. In Minnesota, the government required five regiments from the state, but the attention was diverted to a brewing crisis on its western border. \n\nThe Sioux, relocated to reservations after the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota in 1851, were dissatisfied with their living conditions. President Lincoln called for 600,000 men to join the war effort, while the government struggled to manage the situation with the Sioux. With debts deducted from their government annuities, hunger and frustration boiled over into violence. On August 18, 1862, the Sioux launched a surprise attack on the upper agency, creating a wave of destruction that spread throughout the state.", "During the American Civil War, the US government faced multiple challenges, including the Southern rebellion and foreign intervention. In Minnesota, the Sioux, dissatisfied with their living conditions, launched a surprise attack on the upper agency on August 18, 1862. Governor Ramsey called an emergency session to arm volunteers and help refugees.\n\nMajor General Hitchcock's troops and Ex-Gov. Sibley led the military response, but they were hampered by poorly armed and short-staffed regiments. Despite this, Sibley successfully relieved Fort Ridgley from 700-800 Sioux warriors. Meanwhile, Judge Flandrau organized a 300-man volunteer force to aid New Ulm, but they were outnumbered and suffered heavy losses. \n\nCaptain Grant's detail and the Cullen Guards were sent to bury the dead and rescue survivors but were ambushed and eventually surrendered. Amidst the chaos, Dakota Indian, Other Day, piloted hundreds of civilians to safety, crediting the mercy of the Great Spirit.

Little Crow, the chief instigator, escaped but was later killed by a farmer. The remaining Indians were kept in close confinement until spring, when they were taken to Davenport and eventually to a point on the Missouri river, where they were allowed to sow the seeds of discontent that would eventually lead to the Custer massacre. Two notable Sioux chiefs, Little Six and Medicine Bottle, were arrested at Fort Gary (Winnipeg) and delivered to Pembina in January 1864. They were later tried, condemned, and executed in the presence of 10,000 people, with Little Six confessing to having murdered 50 white men, women, and children.\n\nThe situation in Minnesota was further complicated by the need to transport supplies to the troops on the frontier, which was a significant challenge due to the lack of railroads. The military authorities had to issue orders to impress teams and horses into government service, leading to clashes with farmers who were reluctant to cooperate. The government ultimately reimbursed the owners of the teams for their use, but not before seizing the carriage team of Governor Ramsey and the team of a silver-haired farmer named Hilks, who was a sympathizer of the South.\n\nIn response to the conflict, the ladies of St. Paul organized the Ladies Aid Society to provide supplies to sick and wounded soldiers, as well as to assist destitute refugees. The society was led by prominent women like Mrs. Stella Selby and Miss M.O. Holyoke, who collected sanitary supplies and clothing for the soldiers. Their efforts brought joy and relief to many soldiers who were suffering in hospital tents and swamps. The conflict also had significant economic consequences for the Sioux, who forfeited their lands in Minnesota, amounting to about 750,000 acres, worth around $15,000,000 at the time.", "The story begins with a nostalgic poem about running with an old machine, likely a reference to firefighting equipment. The poem sets a tone of reminiscence and appreciation for the past. The narrative then shifts to a historical account of the development of firefighting equipment in Europe, dating back over three hundred years. The introduction of leather hoses and suction pipes in Amsterdam in 1670 marked significant advancements in firefighting technology. \n\nIn the late 17th and early 18th centuries, improvements were made to fire engines in England, with the introduction of oak cisterns and spiral metal pipes. The United States adopted bucket fire departments and hand engines in the early 19th century, with the New York volunteer fire department being a prominent institution. The volunteer fire department was a popular attraction at state fairs, with various cities competing to showcase their skills.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, began to organize its own firefighting efforts. In 1850, the town fathers passed an ordinance requiring property owners to have buckets marked with the word \"Fire\" and their name. The first attempt at organizing a fire brigade was made by R.C. Knox in 1851, who purchased ladders and a small band of men to respond to fires. However, it was two public-spirited citizens, John McCloud and Thompson Ritchie, who brought the first fire engine to the Northwest in the early 1850s. The engine proved to be a valuable asset in protecting the property of local merchants.\n\nIn 1854, Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 was organized, with John McCloud as the driving force behind its creation. The company was initially equipped with a truck, hooks and ladders, and one fire engine with hose. However, the equipment proved inadequate, and the city eventually purchased two double-deck hand fire engines in 1858. The city also constructed cisterns to provide an adequate supply of water. A notable member of the company was A.D. Martin, a red-headed Irishman who was known for his enthusiasm and tendency to declare that he would kill an Irishman after every fire.\n\nIn 1857, Hope Engine Company No. 1 was organized, and they petitioned the city for 500 feet of hose. The company was given possession of one of the new engines in 1858 and was housed in a new brick building on Third street. The conflict with the Sioux Native American tribe in Minnesota was a significant event during this period, with the US government facing challenges in responding to the crisis. The Ladies Aid Society was formed to provide supplies to soldiers and assist destitute refugees, with prominent women like Mrs. Stella Selby and Miss M.O. Holyoke playing key roles in the organization.

Two more companies, Hope Engine Company No. 1 and Minnehaha Engine Company No. 2, were established in 1857 and 1858, respectively. A.D. Martin, a fiery Irishman, and officers H.P. Grant, M.J. O'Connor, and H.B. Terwilliger led these organizations.\n\nThe city's growth led to increased fire risk, with a significant hotel fire in 1852. In 1859, the first annual fire department parade took place, featuring four companies. A lady, Mrs. Bartlett Presley, became a guardian angel to the fire department, providing refreshments to the weary firefighters.

A massive fire on 16 March 1860 destroyed over 30 buildings on Third street, leaving only three structures standing. The Cosmopolitan hotel, which housed local newspaper operations, was destroyed in an unspecified year.

A notable hotel, the International, cost $110,000 to construct and became a popular gathering place, hosting prominent figures like General William H. Seward and General Sibley. However, it suffered from a devastating fire in 1869, likely caused by a laundry lamp, which spread rapidly due to strong winds. Night watchman Pete O'Brien played a crucial role in helping guests escape safely.\n\nIn the following years, several hotels suffered from fires, including the Park Place hotel in 1878, the Carpenter house in 1879, and the Concert Hall building in 1870, a significant calamity that destroyed a large concert hall. The fire department used cisterns and a steamer to pump water through over two thousand feet of hose to combat these blazes.
